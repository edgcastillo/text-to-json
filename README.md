The problem was simple, I wanted a JSON file with a list of the best rated movies on IMDB. I found a txt file with a list of 250 best imdb movies, the problem was there was some fields that I didn't need it. So first I had to clean up the top250.txt with the info that I needed and then transform it to a JSON format. Using Node and Stream libraries I was able to extract the information I needed from the txt file and write another txt file with only the title of the movie and the year it was released, then write another script to copy txt and create a json file. The end result is imdb.json.
